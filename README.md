# Week 3 Assignment

## Description
This Python program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. It uses a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that applies the discount only if the discount percentage is **20% or higher**. Otherwise, it returns the original price.

## Features
- Accepts user input for original price and discount percentage.
- Applies discount only if the discount is 20% or more.
- Prints the final price after discount or the original price if no discount applies.
- Handles invalid (non-numeric) inputs gracefully.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
2. Save the script as `discount_calculator.py`.
3. Run the script from your terminal or command prompt:
    ```bash
    python discount_calculator.py
    ```
4. Follow the prompts to enter the price and discount percentage.
